1)//We saw how to create form in JS
	//how to create form in React

	1.1) maintain up to date state 
			//state is updated with any change that happens in form inputs
	
		1.1.2) Define a state to hold current data typed
			const[firstName, setFirstName] = React.useState(" ") 

		1.1.2) listen for changes to this input
				How? add onChange={handleChange}
					handleChange -> outputs: "changed"		
	
		1.1.3) Test: type any keyword --> outputs : changed

		1.1.4) What parameter are we receiving as part of event listener function?
			 function handleChange(__)
		
		//by default browser passes an event object
			 function handleChange(event)

		//What eevent object contains?		
			v large object 
			has a lot of information
			if we console.log(event) 	--> > SyntheticBaseEvent
			//can open dev tools and see what is inside this event object

		//Imp Property in event object: target

		1.1.5) What is the target property in event object.How can we use it?

		>console.log(event.target)		
	
		
		//What output of console.log(event.target) we get? HTML element
			<input type="text" placeholder="First Name">
		//What is this element? element that triggered the event
		
		1.1.6) What is this event.target?	
			DOM object: that triggered the event

		1.1.7) DOM object has many properties like this
				target
				value : ex console.log(event.target.value) ---> if we type "as" in form input --> it will console log that
				
		//What is happening? every time firstName state changes --> component re-rendered

		1.1.8) Challenge: Update firstName state --> on every keystroke	
		
				 Try console.log(firstName) before handleChange() is declared
				 //everytime state changes --> component re-rendered --> console.log(firstName) is rerun
				
			1.1.8.1) use setFirstName() setter
					//note: we dont care about the previous state 
					//what parameter to pass? event.target.value //why? this is the information currrently typed into input box
				      //setFirstName(event.target.value) 		 
			1.1.8.2) Refresh
					//Type into input --> State gets updated with every keystroke.

	//Throwing a wrentch: prevent something from happening smoothly
