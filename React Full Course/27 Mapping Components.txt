1) What achieved? all data in jokesData.js now gets returned (how? map) and is stored in jokeElements variable
	We just return js element jokeElments

	//Separate component experience
	//getting data from file instead of hardcoding


a) App.js

import React from "react"
import Joke from "./Joke"
import jokesData from "./jokesData"T

export default function App() {
return (
const jokeElements = jokesData.map(joke => {			//use .map to apply a function that returns the component<Joke /> , apply to 											every element of jokeElements
	return <Joke setup={joke.setup} punchline={joke.punchline} />
})
    return(
	<div>
		{jokeElements}
	</div>
 )
)
}


b) jokesData
//All joke data in an array

export default [
{setup: "I got my daughter a fridge for her birthday.", punchline: "I can't wait to see her face
light up when she opens it."}, {setupz "How did the hacker escape the police?", punchline: "He just ransomware!"},

{setup: "I got my daughter a fridge for her birthday.", punchline: "I can't wait to see her face
light up when she opens it."}, {setupz "How did the hacker escape the police?", punchline: "He just ransomware!"},

{setup: "I got my daughter a fridge for her birthday.", punchline: "I can't wait to see her face
light up when she opens it."}, {setupz "How did the hacker escape the police?", punchline: "He just ransomware!"}
]


c) Joke.js


import React from "react"
export default function Joke(props) {
	return (
		<div>
			{props.setup && <h3>Setup: {props.setup}</h3>}
			<p>Punchline: {props.punchline}</p>
			<hr />
		</div>
)
}
