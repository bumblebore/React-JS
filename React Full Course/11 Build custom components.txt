right now we take all code put in a variable and React.render it
HTML also did same.
How to make components that we talked about?

we have boiled down taking large html code --> 1 variable



a) What functions used for? reusability of code
	a.1) Create a temporary function
		let that function return the html
			instead of  variable, store that code in that function
		Conclusion: what achieved? successfully rendered a function
		now how to reuse it


	

	a.2) Convention: function name: Pascal case : first letter capital
				<unction /> in ReactDOM.render

	Code sstill working

	a.3) Note: in function you still need <>  </> tags
	
	a.4) Still one monolithic component Why df!
	How to compose different components together

	

import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom"

function Temp() {
	return (
	
		<>
		<header>
			<nav>		
				<img src="./react-logo.png" width= "40px" />
			</nav>
