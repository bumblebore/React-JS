1) How data is passed form 1 component to other in react

Given: In a component tree


Component rendered from Top --> Bottom
What components can render? other components,custom Components,regular dom elements (divs,h1s)

1.1) initialize state in one of the components
1.2) 

		 []1
	  /		  \
     []2		    []3

  / 	   \ 		   /	   \

[State]4   []5	 []6	    []7

1.3) What if component under same parent  needs this data from this state?

How to pass data to sibling component

1.4)  Is there any reference? No
	How to let Body use Header's state?

pass state Child4 --> Parent2 --> Child5		
	How to pass ? using props
	Will the state if changed get updated everywhere? Yes

1.5) What if []2 wants from []4? 
	[]2 to []3 not allowed

Solution: Raise state to []1, pass more props down towards []3

React: Soluton? Context	
	//other solutions: Third party state management systems: Redux
	








Child component also doesnt know if upper uncle component exists

Code:
App.js

import React from "react"
import Header from "./Header"
import Body from ".lBody"
export default function App() {
	return (
		<main>
			<Header />
			<Body />
			</main>
	)
}


Header.js

import React fron "react"
export default function Header() {
const [user, setUser] = React.use$tate("Joe")
return (
<header>
<p>Current user: {user}</p>
</header> 
 )
}

Body.js

import React from "react"
export default function Body() {
return (
<section>
<h1>Welcone back, ___!</h1>
</section>
 )
}
