a) We learnt how we can use html like jsx in .js files using ReactDOm and React
What about importing styles.css? 
 All styles in a folder styles.css
	webpack instance runs create-react-app
	webpack instance uses "style loader" --> import styles directly into index.js


When building the project, wont have lots of files and folders in src directory
	webpack bundles evthing into 1 GIANT JS file

	-----> In end 
	we have 
			index.html	
			index.css
			index.js	//Bundled up




b) Can avoid hardcoding image, inistead import
	Helps webpack bundle also
	everything when has a reference isntead of hardcoding	// no broken link between component and image

import React from "react"
import reactLogo from "../images/react—icon-small.png"
export defauht funCtion Navbar() {
return (
<nav>
<img
src="reactLogo"
alt="React Logo"
className="nav—-icon"
/>
<h3 className:"nav-—logo_text">ReactFactss/h3>
<h4 className:"nav—-title">React Course - Project 1
</nav>
)
}
