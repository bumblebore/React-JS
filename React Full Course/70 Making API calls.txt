
Given:

Objective : interact with api

1) API lives outsidde of our application
2) 
	2.1)request information from api
		How to request info from api in React?
		a) GET the data (fetch)			//make a fetch request to star wars api	//contains information aobut star wars 											characters and planets and movies
			//How to get data? (fetch/ tool like axios)
			a.1) resolve the promise that we get back from fetch
				convert json response --> javscript object that we can use

			a.2) console.log() the data of the javascript object
			//.then(data => console.log(data))
			>Output:
			{namez "Luke Skywalker", height: "172", mass: "77", hair_color: "blond", skin_color: "fair", eye_color: "blue",
			birth_year: "lQBBY", gender: "male", homeworld: "httpszl/swapi.dev/api/planets/l/", films:

	
			a.3) stringify the entire object
			Why stringify?
				
			a.4) put the stringified object in state

		b) Save that data to state
		c) do whatever you want with data saved in state

		d) Test -> refresh
		What we get? data from api as output
		>{	
		"name": "Luke Skywalker",
		"height": "172",
		"mass": "77",
		"hair_color": "blond",	
		"skin_color": "fair",	
		"eye_color": "blue",
		"birth_year" : " 19BBY " ,
		...
		}

3) What is going behind the scenes?		
 3.1) console.log("Component rendered") just before fetching data from api
		
 3.2) Every time app component will re-render / render
	Refresh
	"Component Rendered" shows repeatedly. (infinite loop)
	Why console.log is running in infinite loop?
	
		fetch is at top level of App component
 		App component renders --> fetch gets called --> setStarWarsData(data) gets called --> state updated --> component  re-rendered -> fetch again called --> infinite loop
		
	How to solve this repeated fetching?
	   	
	3.2.1) comment out setState part
			//setState is causing the issue
	3.2.2) These are Side effects in React --> deal in next lesson			


	import React from "react"
	export default function App() {
		const [starWarsData, setStarWarsData] = React.useState({})	
		console.log("Component rendered")	
		fetch ( "https://swapi.dev/api/people/l")
			.then(res => res.json)
			.then(starWarsData => console.log(data))
		return (
		<div>
			<pre>{JSON.stringify(starWarsData, null, 2)} </pre>
		</div>
	)
}

	

	2.2)submit information to api
