1) How to manage side effects in react

	1.1) What are primary tasks of React?
		a) Works with dom in browser --> to render UI	//how? jsx + html look alike elements
			underhood --> React jsx ---> HTML

		b) Managing state
			 React remembers state value from one render to next
				We can hook into this state. How? useState() hook

		c) Keep UI updated whenever state change occcurs



	1.2) What React cant handle on its own?
			Things that are outside of React's reach
			  a) local storage on browser

			  b) api / database interactions	
				where? in code
				why? React not incharge of api code	// React doesnt know what api we are reaching out to

			  c) Subscriptions
				//What are websockets used for?
					client -- server communication protocol
					//used for real time connections (online games, chat apps, stock trading platforms)
				//Why need websockets?
					traditional http is stateless (each request = independent transaction))
					//in efficient for applications that need constant connection between client and server

				//What websocket does? push data real time
								//client doesnt have to poll the server for updates	
								//Ex tracking changes made by multiple users to a shared doc in real time


				if we include websockets in App	
				//what if we have 2 pieces of state that we have to sync
				or lets say 1 sstate to react to a change in another piece of state

				//What react will do?
					manage state of each one behind the scenes
				//
					its not looking for crossover between both states
			 
			   d) Conclusion:
				 when we comment out code
				 React is still trying to manage state  + keep state and screen in sync
				//react has no way to stop rendering	//What if App component receieved props
											props also changing
				

			   e) Solution by React team: useEffect() hook  			
		
		
2)
	2.1) What is useEffect() hook?
			Gives developers blank canvas
			can use blank canvas to intereact outside of react ecosystem

			What react ecosystem contains? state, props, UI	
			
			//What use effect does? helps sync state -- with -- outside systems 
												//what outside systems? local storage/api/subscriptions

	2.2) useEffect() hook documentation React
		How to use useEffect hook?

		2.1) get familiar with React class lifecycle methods
			it contains componentDidMount , componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount hook
			//these are class life cycle methods

		2.2)  useEffect is like these lifecycle methods
		//Dont stress if not understanding
		//advice: dont think useEffect() as a way to hook into lifecycle methods
		
		2.3) 	//Advance topic useEffect() //can study later
